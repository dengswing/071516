- the load/save sequences are not automated to give you freedom to test and develop further;
- after you build something you can load on top - at that point, the map is unrecoverable,
since the building indexes get mixed up/ some buildings might occupy the same space.


- the server save sends a copy of the local save to the server;
- make sure you save locally before saving to the server.

- the save file also contains the sound on/off options
